# Web-Apps-in-Java-Examples 
## Disclaimer
The code is structured in exercises.
1) The text of the exercises is in italian but you'll understand what the exercise asks running the code (except for the last one)
2) The code contains comments and some variable names in italian too
3) A few of the last exercise could have errors. If you find them you can use Github you can fix the code. Thank you!

## What you can find in this Repo
1) a folder (Exercises) full of Java projects to develop simple Web Apps (clients, servers, servlets, weblets...)
2) a folder (Text of Exercises) summarizes what each program should do (in Italian).

## What you need to run this code
1) Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers
2) JRE (I used v.1.8.0_251 but you can use newer versions)
3) Apache Tomcat (I used version 9.0)
4) Apache CXF Library (I used v.3.2.7, you can use newer versions but in that case you should update some code to make 2 projects of this repo work)
